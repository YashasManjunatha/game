Game: Project Specification

1) The Vortex variant of Breakout was interesting because it fundamentally changed up the game by altering the shape of stage.

2) Levels
	a. Level 1 - Triangle
	The stage walls will be shaped similar to a triangle and in the middle the blocks will be arranged in an upside down triangle formation. In the center will be a power-up block.

	b. Level 2 - Square
	The typically shaped stage will have a rectangular formation of blocks in the middle. In the center will be an extra life block.

	c. Level 3 - Pentagon
	This stage will be shaped like a pentagon with a pentagon formation of blocks to clear inside. In the center will be another power up block.

3) Blocks
	a. Regular Block - Cleared after one hit.
	b. Power-Up Block - Drops a random power up. Cleared after one hit.
	c. Extra Life Block - If this block is hit, the player gets an additional life.

4) Power Ups
	a. Paddle Flip - Picking this up flips the control of the paddle (i.e. pressing the right arrow makes the paddle move left) for 15 seconds.
	b. Bounce Back - When the ball hits the paddle, it bounces back the same way it came. This power up is active for 15 seconds.
	c. Paddle Speed Up - This power up increases the speed of the paddle for 15 seconds.

5) Cheat Codes
	a. Key '1', '2', and '3' to jump to the corresponding level.
	b. Key 'L' to add an extra life.
	c. Key 'F' for the flip power up to activate.
	d. Key 'B' for the bounce back power up to activate.
	e. Key 'S' for the speed up power up to activate.

6) Something Extra
	Inspired by the Vortex variant of Breakout, in my version each level will have different stage shape. This is a substantial addition to the game because it fundamentally alters the ball movement in the stage and forces the player to adapt their strategy based on the shape of the level.
